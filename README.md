# Surprise

This was a surprise coding challenge that we were only given 3 hours to complete. The food files are there as an example for creating the event files. The app had to enable a user to create events.The only catch was that the time of the event had to translate the user input of the time into words, if I remember correctly.

You can see we used Spring Boot. It was required. Also we were required to use Angular.
